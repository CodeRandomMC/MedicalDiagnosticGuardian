# LLM Strategy: Federated Fine-Tuning of Specialized Open-Source Models

This document provides a detailed overview of the Large Language Model (LLM) strategy for the Medical Diagnostic Guardian. This approach is designed to ensure high performance, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with our federated, privacy-preserving architecture.

### 1. Core Strategy: Mixture of Experts

Instead of relying on a single, monolithic, general-purpose AI, the system employs a "mixture of experts" (MoE) methodology. We start with a powerful, general-purpose open-source model and then fine-tune smaller, specialized versions for distinct clinical tasks. This creates a collection of "expert" models that are faster, more accurate, and more efficient for their specific purpose.

### 2. LLM Specifics

- **Base Model Selection:** We will utilize a strong, permissively licensed open-source model as our foundation. Candidates include `Mistral-7B`, `Llama-3-8B`, or a medically pre-trained variant like `MediTron-7B`. These models offer a balance of powerful reasoning capabilities and a manageable size suitable for local hosting.
- **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning:** The base model will be fine-tuned into separate, lightweight instances for dedicated clinical functions:
  - **Patient Triage Model:** Trained on structured medical interview protocols and care level guidelines.
  - **Differential Diagnosis Model:** Trained on curated diagnostic manuals, clinical guidelines, and anonymized case data.
- **Continuous Improvement:** This federated approach allows for continuous, decentralized fine-tuning of the models based on real-world clinical feedback, without centralizing sensitive data.

### 3. Performance, Hosting, and Optimization

- **Hosting Infrastructure:** The specialized models are designed to be self-hosted on-premises at each clinic or on secure regional servers. This approach is fundamental to our federated architecture, minimizing internet dependency, ensuring low-latency inference for real-time clinical use, and keeping data within the local trust boundary.
- **Performance Optimization:** To ensure the models can run on cost-effective and accessible hardware, we will implement 4-bit quantization (e.g., using QLoRA) during the fine-tuning process and for inference. This technique dramatically reduces the memory footprint and computational power required, enabling the models to operate efficiently on servers with mid-range, non-specialized GPUs.

### 4. Cost Model and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

This strategy is designed for long-term economic sustainability.

- **Upfront Costs:** The initial investment will cover the development of the fine-tuning pipeline and the procurement of modest on-premises server hardware for the pilot clinics.
- **Operational Costs:** Ongoing costs are predictable and minimal, consisting primarily of electricity and routine maintenance for the local servers.
- **TCO Advantage:** A key benefit of this self-hosted, open-source model is the elimination of recurring per-token or API call fees charged by third-party model providers. This significantly lowers the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) at scale, making the system financially viable for resource-constrained rural healthcare facilities.
